    "Machine learning is teaching a machine to learn from data. This means programmers aren't needed to explicity do tasks, instead large amounts of data is fed into the machine and the machine uses algorithmns to identify patterns within the data. Using the patterns the machine creates a model that is used to make predictions or carry out tasks without being explicity told to do those tasks.\n",
